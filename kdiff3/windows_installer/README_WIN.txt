KDiff3-Version: 0.9.99
Homepage: http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net

KDiff3 is a program that
- compares and merges two or three input files or directories,
- shows the differences line by line and character by character (!),
- provides an automatic merge-facility and
- an integrated editor for comfortable solving of merge-conflicts
- and has an intuitive graphical user interface.

Now KDiff3-strings are translated into some languages by the KDE-I18N-team. 
(*.qm-files in the KDiff3-directory)

See the Changelog.txt for a list of fixed bugs and new features.


Windows-specific information for the precompiled KDiff3 version:
================================================================

This executable is provided for the convenience of users who don't have a
compiler at hand.

You may redistribute it under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE.

Note that there is NO WARRANTY for this program.

Installation:
- The installer was initially created by Sebastien Fricker (sebastien.fricker@web.de).
  It is based on the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (http://nsis.sourceforge.net)

- You can place the directory where you want it. But don't separate the file
  kdiff3.exe from the others, since they are needed for correct execution.  
  (Using kdiff3.exe standalone is possible except for translations and help.)

- Integration with WinCVS: When selected the installer sets KDiff3 to be the
  default diff-tool for WinCVS if available.
  Registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinCvs\wincvs\CVS settings: "P_Extdiff" and "P_DiffUseExtDiff"

- Integration with TortoiseSVN: When selected the installer sets KDiff3 to be the
  default diff-tool for TortoiseSVN if available.
  Registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TortoiseSVN: "Diff" and "Merge"

- Integration with Explorer (1): When selected KDiff3 will be added to the "Send To"
  menu in the context menu. If you then select two files or two directories and
  choose "Send To"->"KDiff3" then KDiff3 will start and compare the specified files.

- Integration with Explorer (2): When selected Diff-Ext-For-KDiff3 will be installed.
  This is a Shell-Extension which adds an entry "KDiff3" into the context menu of 
  Windows Explorer. (e.g. when right-clicking a file or directory) With this it
  is possible to select files and directories sequentially and in separate directories 
  for comparison with KDiff3. This is based on Diff-Ext by Sergey Zorin 
  (http://diff-ext.sourceforge.net) with extensions for KDiff3 by Joachim Eibl. 
  This extension is not under GPL but under a BSD-style licence. (See file DIFF-EXT-LICENSE.txt.)

- SVN Merge Tool: Allows to use KDiff3 for explicit graphical merges with Subversion.
  This installation option copies a file diff3_cmd.bat into your Application Data subdirectory.
  (C:\Documents and Settings\Username\Application Data\Subversion\diff3_cmd.bat)
  (Installation is disabled by default) 

- Integration with Rational ClearCase from IBM: Allows to use KDiff3 as comparison 
  and merge tool for text files under Clearcase. KDiff3 tries to locate the "map"-file 
  (e.g.: C:\Program Files\Rational\Clearcase\lib\mgrs\map) which tells clearcase 
  which tool to use for which filetype and operation. KDiff3 stores a backup in 
  map.preKDiff3Install (if is doesn't exist yet) and modifies the map file so that 
  KDiff3 is used for text files. On KDiff3-uninstallation the entries containing 
  "KDiff3" are restored. The map-file is normal text, so you can also adjust it 
  yourself. (Installation for ClearCase is disabled by default) 

Since this program was actually developed for GNU/Linux, there might be Windows
specific problems I don't know of yet. Please write me about problems you encounter.

Known bugs:
- Links are not handled correctly. (This is because links in Windows are not
  the same as under Un*x-filesystems.)

Exception from the GPL:
    As a special exception, the copyright holder Joachim Eibl gives permission
    to link this program with the Qt-library (commercial or non-commercial edition)
    from Trolltech (www.trolltech.com), and he permits to distribute the resulting
    executable, without including the source code for the Qt-library in the
    source distribution.



Start from commandline:
- Comparing 2 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2
- Merging 2 files:         kdiff3 file1 file2 -o outputfile
- Comparing 3 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 file3
- Merging 3 files:         kdiff3 file1 file2 file3 -o outputfile
     Note that file1 will be treated as base of file2 and file3.

If all files have the same name but are in different directories, you can
reduce typework by specifying the filename only for the first file. E.g.:
- Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 dir1/filename dir2 dir3
(This also works in the open-dialog.)

- Comparing 2 directories: kdiff3 dir1 dir2
- Merging 2 directories:   kdiff3 dir1 dir2-o destinationdir
- Comparing 3 directories: kdiff3 dir1 dir2 dir3
- Merging 3 directories:   kdiff3 dir1 dir2 dir3 -o destinationdir
(Please read the documentation about comparing/merging directories,
especially before you start merging.)

If you start without arguments, then a dialog will appear where you can
select your files and directories via a filebrowser.

For more documentation, see the help-menu or the subdirectory doc.

Have fun!
