- Directory-menu: Fold/Unfold all subdirs
- Bugfix for 3-way auto-merge: A line deleted from the base in B and C

- KDiff3 is now a KPart
   - in KDevelop3 it can be used to compare the current text with the
     last saved version, or the current version on disk with the last cvs version.
   - in Konqueror it can be used to look at a unified *.patch-file if one complete
     version is available too.
- Documentation is now in docbook-format.
- "Toggle Split Orientation" for Diff-Input windows. (Good for long lines.)

- Fix for cursor blinking in the topline of the MergeResultWindow.


Version 0.9.61 - 2003/06/07
===========================
- Compilation problem fixed.
- Directory merge: Preserving file attributes and times during copy. (now also for Win32)

New features:
- New ways to select input for the diff window:
  - Pasting clipboard text into a diff window.
  - Drag and drop a file from a filemanager (e.g. konqueror) onto a diff window.
  - Drag and drop text from an editor (e.g. kate) onto a diff window.
  Reanalysis starts immediately if no merge is in progress.
  (This should help you to compare similar parts in the same file.)
- New/Deleted white lines are now also considered as white deltas.
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts for most actions (KDE version only).
- The overview now also distinguishes whitespace deltas.
New preprocessor options:
- You can now define your own external Preprocessor and LineMatchingPreprocessor:
- "Convert to upper case",
- "Ignore numbers"
Fixed bugs:
- Directory merge: Preserving file attributes and times during copy.
  (not for Win32 yet)

  and corrected support for external diff.
New Features:
- Search-function: Search for a string in all open text windows.
- Special background colors for current region.
- Button to toggle showing of whitespace in differences.
- Buttons to go to next/prev unsolved (!) conflict.
- While auto-advance waits, no more choices are allowed.
- New setting: Auto-advance-delay.
  (Note that with delay 0 fast clicks might be detected as double clicks and the second
  click does nothing. My advice: Prefer the keyboard-shortcuts Ctrl-1/2/3)
- Functions to Show/Hide Diff Window A, B or C. The other windows then have more space.
- Merge editor: The right mouse button selects the current region and lets you choose
  A, B or C via a popup menu.
- Commandline option --auto: No GUI if all conflicts are auto-solvable.
- When equal files are compared, then a message box informs you.
- Merge current file: When comparing two or three files, the merge can be started with a single click.
- Option dialog: Warning for "Defaults" added, because it resets all options.
- A warning is given, when the user tries to merge binary files. (i.e. files that contain '\0'-bytes)
Changed behaviour:
- 3 file automerge: When for a line B==C (and A!=B) then C will be selected.
  (In older versions this was a conflict. I was convinced that this is no problem.)
- Auto-Advance now jumps to next unsolved (!) conflict.
- On 256-color-displays KDiff3 uses them. (Previously KDiff3 only used 16 colors.)
- On 16-color-displays the Defaults-button in the options dialog selects special colors.
